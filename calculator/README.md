### Objective

Your assignment is to build a calculator app that maintains history.

### Tasks

- Implement assignment using:
  - Language: **Javascript or TypeScript**
  - Framework: **React, Vue, or Angular**
- Build out the project using these [Figma mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/6LK5oybY7WpjkIesTBMdED/Developer-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1) as a reference. Feel free to take some creative liberty here.
- Try to use some sort of centralized state management to maintain calculator history. Other parts of the app may want to utilize the calculator history in the future (a unit converter for example), so make sure it's easy to access/update.

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Javascript/TypeScript** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
