### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a movie streaming dashboard.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Thikkiiana City,** on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. Wookies are the main exporter of Computer Technology for the New Republic so naturally you roll up your sleeves and get to work. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

- Implement assignment using:
  - Language: **Javascript or TypeScript**
  - Framework: **React, Vue, or Angular**
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Build out the project using the mocks in the `/Designs` folder as a reference. Feel free to take some creative liberty here.
- Connect your application to this **Movie Database**: `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies`
- For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer Wookie2021"` header
- Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Make sure to group movies by categories**.
- Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
- Make sure that linking to detail pages as well as bookmarking works as expected
- Implement search by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Javascript/TypeScript** best practices
- Completeness: Did you complete the features?
- Correctness: Does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways? Does it cover all of the edge cases?
- Scalability: Is the code designed/architected well? Is it component based and modular?
